		<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p id="aboutmeP">Currently attending Johnson County Community College pursing eductaion in Application and Software Development. <br><br>
            I'm a hard working and light hearted employee who takes his job very seriously. In my pervious work history I have strong experience with customer service and that has helped me build in my career leading to some of my best promotions. Customer service is really at the root of how I go about my work and know everyone is to be treated equally and fairly in a warm tone of voice.<br><br>
            Through my years I was promoted up from a starting position at MaritzCX as an Assigner/Editor to an Assistant Supervisor and trainer for new employees then promoted again to Project Supervisor of the team I worked on. For more information on these roles please see my resume down below!<br><br>
            When I'm not working I enjoy being a father to my new born baby girl Maggie and if I have free time on my hands I enjoy playing video games or playing guitar. I also enjoy building and servicing PCs and phones for friends and family and I hope to one day open a repair business of my own!

Simultaneously implemented a seamless officewide transition from Dell Windows XP machines by uninstalling those and installing new Chrome Boxes throughout the facility.
